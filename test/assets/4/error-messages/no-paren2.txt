    • Couldn't match expected type ‘[String] -> String’
                  with actual type ‘[Char]’
    • The function ‘unlines’ is applied to two arguments,
      but its type ‘[String] -> [Char]’ has only one
      In the first argument of ‘putStr’, namely
        ‘(unlines reverse (lines input))’
